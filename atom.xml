<ul>
<li>2.Where do you set up the databases?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">Databases must be set up first in the database engine you are using. For example, at school, you are likely using Microsoft SQL Server and must create the databases in the SQL Server Management Studio. If you are using the student edition, you are using Microsoft SQL Server and must set the databases up in the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. After you have created the databases in the database engine you are using, you must create them in the Sage 300 ERP Database Setup Utility program, which is installed with Sage 300 ERP.</span></p>  
<ul>
<li>3.Where will you find SAMINC and SAMSYS? What are they?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">SAMINC and SAMSYS are both sample data files. Although the files are installed and the databases are created in both Microsoft SQL and the Database Setup Utility program during the installation of Sage 300 ERP 2012, they must be loaded into Sage 300 ERP using the Data Loader Utility. Instructions on how to load the sample data files into Sage 300 ERP can be found in Lesson 1, page 17.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>6.After setting up the company information, can you change the functional currency selected?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">No. The functional currency cannot be changed once it has been selected. If you have selected the wrong functional currency, you must delete the database files through Windows Explorer, delete the databases in both the Sage 300 ERP Database Utility program and the database engine and then recreate the databases again.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>7.How many fiscal periods can you set up for your company?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">You can set up 12 or 13 fiscal periods for your company. Select 12 if your fiscal calendar is divided into calendar months. Select 13 if your fiscal calendar is divided into four-week periods. If you select 13, a second field will be displayed where you must indicate which quarter has four fiscal periods.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>9.What is the purpose of setting up schedules?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">Schedules are set up so they can be assigned to recurring entries in the General Ledger, Accounts Payable or Accounts Receivable modules that will allow automatic processing of the recurring entries.  Schedules can be created to occur on a daily, weekly, semi-monthly, monthly or yearly basis.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>13.In the fiscal period, a period can be locked or unlocked. What is the difference between these two options?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">If a fiscal period is unlocked, you can post transactions to it; if a fiscal period is locked, you cannot post transactions to it.  You can lock or unlock a period at any time.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>20.What is the purpose of the database dump feature?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">The purpose of the database dump feature is to extract a Sage 300 ERP database creating a flat-sequential file that allows you to move it from one database format to another. For example, if the school has Microsoft SQL Server installed and you are using the student edition with Microsoft SQL Server installed, the only way to read the files from one database format (version) to another is to perform the database dump feature and then the database load feature. This is also true if you are moving the files from a Microsoft SQL Server database to any of the other databases supported by Sage 300 ERP 2012. 
<p>You can also use the database dump feature to create a backup of your files. You must perform the database load function when you are ready to load your data.<br>
</span></p></p>
<ul>
<li>22.What is the purpose of the database load feature?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">The purpose of the database load feature is to load a dataset into a Sage 300 ERP database that was created by the database dump function. This allows you to move data between different database formats or from different database versions (including programs that have different service packs installed). You require both the .dct file and the folder that is created during the database dump feature to load a dataset.
</span></p>
<p>##Chap 2</p>
<ul>
<li>3.Explain segments that are used in account numbers. How many segments can be used in an account number? What is the largest possible size of a segment?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">In Sage 300 ERP Premium edition, an account number can be up to 45 characters in length including delimiters. These characters can be divided into as many as ten segments. The largest possible size of a segment is 15 characters.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>6.Where are source codes used?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">Source codes are used when entering batches. They identify the type of transaction entered and the source journal where the transaction originated. You cannot enter transactions in the General Ledger without a source code.  Source Codes can also be printed in user defined Source Journal Reports.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>7.List the four print destinations that are available. How do you change the print destination?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">The print destinations are as follows:
<ol>
<li>Printer</li>
<li>Preview (screen)</li>
<li>File</li>
<li>E-mail</li>
</ol>
<p>You can change the print destination by clicking on File from the menu on the Company Desktop, selecting Print Destination, and then selecting the desired option. You can also double click on the printer icon on the status bar to quickly display the Print Destination window and then make the necessary changes.<br>
</span></p></p>
<ul>
<li>8.What is the purpose of creating Optional Fields in the General Ledger module?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">Optional fields created in the General Ledger module can be used to customize your chart of accounts or store additional information with transaction details.</span></p>
<h2 id="chap-3">Chap 3</h2>
<ul>
<li>2.What is the maximum number of characters allowed in an account?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">Account numbers can be up to 45 characters in length, including segment delimiters.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>3.How many segments can be included in an account number?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">A maximum of ten segments can be included in an account number in the Sage 300 ERP 2012 Premium edition. Other versions of the Sage 300 ERP program only allow three segments.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>7.List three restrictions for deleting accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">
Three restrictions for deleting accounts are:
<ol>
<li>it must be inactive</li>
<li>it may not be used as a retained earnings account</li>
<li>it may not be used on the allocation tab by an auto allocation account</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, refer to page 117 in the textbook.<br>
</span></p></p>
<ul>
<li>9.Where do you set a default closing account?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">The default closing account is set on the Account tab of the G/L Options form.</span></p>
<h2 id="chap-4">Chap 4</h2>
<ul>
<li>3.What are the two entry modes available for entering General Ledger transactions? What is the difference between them</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">The two entry modes available for entering General Ledger transactions are Normal and Quick.  When you use the Normal entry mode, the cursor stops at each field on every detail line for you to complete. When you use the Quick entry mode, the cursor stops at each field on the first detail line for you to complete; however, the reference and description fields are automatically entered for each subsequent detail line.  Although this information is automatically entered, it can be modified.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>6.If you forgot a line in the middle of a batch, how do you add it in its proper place?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">If you press the [INSERT] key, a blank line will be inserted below the current line, allowing you to add a new detail line to the journal entry.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>11.What is the purpose of the posting journal?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">The posting journal lists all entries that have been posted to the General Ledger. This report is an important part of your audit trail.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>12.What is the purpose of the Create New Year function?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">The purpose of the Create New Year function is to close income and expense accounts to retained earnings, and to establish opening balances for the New Year from the previous year’s ending balances. A batch is automatically created and posted during this process.
<p>The Create New Year function will automatically remove transaction history that is older than the number of years of fiscal sets and the number of years of transaction detail that is defined to be kept in the G/L Options form.<br>
</span></p></p>
<ul>
<li>13.What is the purpose of the data integrity check feature? How often should a data<br>
integrity check be performed?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">The purpose of the data integrity check feature is to ensure that your data has not been damaged and is error free. A data integrity check should be performed on a regular basis, and it is a good idea to perform a data integrity check before backing up your data. If you want the data integrity check to fix minor errors, backup your data before performing the Data Integrity Check.</span></p>
<p>##Chap 5</p>
<ul>
<li>2.How do you prevent a budget set from being modified or deleted?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">In order to prevent a budget set from being modified or deleted, you can lock the budget set on the Posting tab of the G/L Options form.</span></p>
<h2 id="chap-6">Chap 6</h2>
<ul>
<li>2.How do you delete a batch?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">Batches are deleted by highlighting the batch in the Batch List window and clicking on the delete button found on the bottom of the screen.  A batch can only be deleted before it is permanently posted. The batch will have a status of Deleted and will be displayed on the Batch List window if the option to Show Posted and Deleted Batches is selected.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>5.Explain the difference between posting a batch within the Batch List window and using the Post Batches icon.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">While in the Batch List window, you can post only one batch at a time by selecting the Post button.  If the batch has not been set ready to post, you will be prompted to set the status to ready to post and then proceed with posting.
<p>Multiple batches can be posted together by using the Post Batches icon.  Only batches that have a status of ready to post will be posted.<br>
</span></p></p>
<ul>
<li>6.Explain what happens to errors found in a batch during posting.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">Errors that are found in batches during posting are automatically placed in the next available batch for correction.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>8.How do you correct posting errors?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">Posting errors are corrected by opening the batch they have been placed in and making the necessary corrections.  Once the error is corrected, you can post the batch or continue to add other entries to it.  It will no longer be an error batch, just another regular batch.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>13.Explain provisional posting.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">Batches are not posted permanently when you select provisional posting, and they can still be modified or deleted. You may post your batches provisionally (temporarily) to see how they affect your General Ledger. Provisional transactions can be viewed on the trial balance report, the batch status report and the provisional posting journal.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>14.Can a batch be modified after it has been provisionally posted? When is the provisionally posted batch deleted?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">A batch can be modified after it has been provisionally posted. The next time you post or provisionally post batches, the provisionally posted status is removed from all provisionally posted batches.  If the provisionally posted batch is within the batches selected for posting, the provisionally posted batch is permanently posted. If the provisionally posted batch was not within the batches selected for posting the next time you post, its status will change back to open.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>15.What is the purpose of creating an allocation batch?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">The purpose of creating an allocation batch is to have the General Ledger module generate a transaction that will credit the amount from the allocation account, thus clearing it out, and debiting the accounts assigned to the allocation account according to the percentage you set up for them.</span></p>
<h2 id="chap-7">Chap 7</h2>
<ul>
<li>1.List the options available in the Chart of Accounts window.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">
The items available in the Chart of Accounts window are:
<ol>
<li>Open</li>
<li>Transactions</li>
<li>Comparison</li>
<li>Budget</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Currency (this option is shown if you have installed the multi-currency module)<br>
</span></p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>6.While viewing the transactions in the Transaction History window, how do you limit the types of transactions displayed?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">You can limit the type of transactions displayed by entering a source code that will only display transactions for that source code.  To see all transactions, leave the source code blank.</span></p>
<h2 id="chap-8">Chap 8</h2>
<ul>
<li>1.List the month-end procedures.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">
The suggested month-end procedures are as follows:
<ol>
<li>post all open batches</li>
<li>perform a data integrity check</li>
<li>backup your data</li>
<li>print General Ledger reports</li>
<li>print Financial Statements<br>
</span></p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>5.What program is required in order to print the financial statements?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">Microsoft Excel version 2003 or higher is required to print the financial statements.  This program must be purchased separately.</span></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="摘录">摘录：</h2>
<p>史铁生　《我与地坛》</p>
<blockquote>
<p>我一连几小时专心致志地想关于死的事，也以同样的耐心和方式想过我为什么要出生。这样想了好几年，最后事情终于弄明白了：一个人，出生了，这就不再是一个可以辩论的问题，而只是上帝交给他的一个事实；上帝在交给我们这件事实的时候，已经顺便保证了它的结果，所以死是一件不必急于求成的事，死是一个必然会降临的节日。这样想过之后我安心多了，眼前的一切不再那么可怕。比如你起早熬夜准备考试的时候，忽然想起有一个长长的假期在前面等待你，你会不会觉得轻松一点？并且庆幸并且感激这样的安排？</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>谁又能把这世界想个明白呢？世上的很多事是不堪说的。你可以抱怨上帝何以要降诸多苦难给这人间，你也可以为消灭种种苦难而奋斗，并为此享有崇高与骄傲，但只要你再多想一步你就会坠入深深的迷茫了：假如世界上没有了苦难，世界还能够存在么？要是没有愚钝，机智还有什么光荣呢？要是没了丑陋，漂亮又怎么维系自己的幸运？要是没有了恶劣和卑下，善良与高尚又将如何界定自己又如何成为美德呢？要是没有了残疾，健全会否因其司空见惯而变得腻烦和乏味呢？我常梦想着在人间彻底消灭残疾，但可以相信，那时将由患病者代替残疾人去承担同样的苦难。如果能够把疾病也全数消灭，那么这份苦难又将由（比如说）像貌丑陋的人去承担了。就算我们连丑陋，连愚昧和卑鄙和一切我们所不喜欢的事物和行为，也都可以统统消灭掉，所有的人都一味健康、漂亮、聪慧、高尚，结果会怎样呢？怕是人间的剧目就全要收场了，一个失去差别的世界将是一条死水，是一块没有感觉没有肥力的沙漠。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>史铁生　《活出爱》</p>
<blockquote>
<p>一旦走向复杂，人与人就是相互的迷宫。这大概又是人的根本处境。我常常感到这样的矛盾：睁开白天的眼睛，看很多人很多事都可憎恶；睁开夜的眼睛，才发现其实人人都在苦弱地挣扎，惟当互爱……上帝把一个危险性最小的机会给了恋人，期待他们‘打开窗户’。上帝大约是在暗示：如果这样你们还不能相互敞开心扉，你们就毫无希望了；如果这样你们还相互隔离或防范，你们就只配受永恒的惩罚。</p>

        </link>
        <updated>2020-12-04T06:56:04.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>写在前面：有时候还挺想写点东西的，虽然文笔比较差，但也就厚着脸皮写了，即使被看到也没关系，反正只要我不尴尬，尴尬的就是别人嘛。</strong></em><br>
　　上了大学以后，我时常会想起一些过去的事，这已经成了一种习惯。从在青海的孩童时期，在哈尔滨读小学的三年，回到老家永丰的六年，再到升入吉安白鹭洲中学的三年高中时光。我在脑海中一遍又一遍地回忆、确认这些一段又一段的记忆，害怕着有一天会把他们忘在哪个不知名的角落。<br>
　　而想的最多的，还是在白鹭洲度过的那段日子。我问过自己很多次，是更喜欢现在看起来十分自由、做三休四的大学生活，还是那个每天上十节课，作业、考试不断的高中生活？<br>
　　答案总是后者。<br>
　　今天我依然记得正式分班（之所以说正式分班，是因为高中开学时军训的分班仅是临时性的，一周后还要正式分班）的那一天。在公告栏确认自己分到八班后，我从八班教室的后门进去，看到门口还空着一个座位，便坐了下去。那时候坐在旁边位子上的是LY，他也成了我在八班第二个认识的人（第一个是YYL，军训分班时我们在一起）。人都到齐后，班主任胡老师要选出一个班长，我记得他那时候是想挑个声音大的同学，他问，谁在军训检阅时带过队。我小心翼翼地举起了手，于是，在军训阅兵第一名的九班带过队的我成了班长。到现在我还觉得老师的决定挺草率的。<br>
　　就我自己的体验而言，高中时代应该分为两个部分，前半部分里，我像个小孩子，对未来尚未有什么担忧，对自己也要求不严，得过且过。后半部分里，我开始真的为自己思考，认真去为了高考奋斗。<br>
　　那会我还是个中二少年，傻事做过不少，每每想起都感觉很羞耻。一直很后悔在自我介绍的时候向大家介绍自己喜欢二次元😂。从网名、头像，一些日常用品（比如U盘、文件夹之类的小物件），到听歌的风格，都是彻头彻尾的二次元人。虽然大家没有明说过，但心里应该都会想这个人好怪<s>甚至很恶心？现在觉得会这样想的才是正常人hhh</s>吧。在这里向各位同学鞠躬谢罪了。某次课堂活动过后，我负责去超市买些零食奖励参与了的同学，鬼使神差地，我多买了一点（当然是用自己的零花钱），在分发零食的时候装作若无其事地给某个女同学的桌上放了一些。原因什么的，我自己也说不清楚，也没必要太深究。高三的时候，在桌子的里面贴满了二次元明信片，希望后面用到这张桌子的同学不要被吓到吧。<br>
　　考上高中后我拥有了自己的第一张银行卡，第一部智能机。我也不好意思说自己还是小孩子，贪玩，但那时候确实还是一心想着玩。老师的要求是周日晚上同学们把手机交上去，由胡老师统一保管，周五（或周六）放学再发还，收手机是我负责。规矩执行到后面总会变形，但现在想想，破坏规则从我这个班长开始，的确不应该。记不清细节了，从某次开始，我就有了两部手机，一部上交，一部留在自己手里。这种情况持续了很长一段时间，我不确定老师知不知道，可能知道了但是不点破吧。后来某人发明了更离谱的方法——在网上买模型机上交。这个就不细说了。<br>
　　城南校区虽然比较偏远，但交通还算方便，而且离市图书馆很近。无事的周末里，图书馆便成了我常去的地方。我向来喜欢读书，而且“食谱”比较杂，什么都看一点<s>但好像看完都没记住</s>，只要100元押金即可办理借书卡免费借阅的市图书馆便成了我的藏宝库。除了借书外，我也常去学校的小书店。有几个同学也会在课间操时间假称身体不舒服而溜去书店。书店中，除了辅导资料外，最多的是村上春树和东野圭吾的作品。我也因此喜欢上，并读了这二位的许多书<s>店里好像还有某人喜欢的渡边淳一</s>。说来，三体三部曲我也是在这里买的，这三本应该是班里被阅读最多的书了。那两年买的书（高三搬去老校区，那边没书店），加上三年里订阅的杂志，在我毕业搬回永丰的时候，着实造成了不小的麻烦，因此我吸取教训，这两年很少买实体书了。<br>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scrapy爬虫框架在实际使用时，单个项目内一次只能运行一个爬虫。<br>
如果想一次运行多个爬虫，可以手动修改配置文件。<br>
按如下步骤操作：</p>
<p>首先由此获取crawl命令的源码<br>
在spiders文件夹的同级目录下创建一个文件夹，名称自拟。<br>
随后进入该文件夹，创建.py文件，名称依然可以自拟。<br>
将crawl命令源码复制进去。<br>
其他部分保持不变，我们重新编写run()方法如下：</p>
<pre><code># 获取爬虫列表
spd_loader_list = self.crawler_process.spider_loader.list()
# 遍历各爬虫
for spname in spd_loader_list or args:
    self.crawler_process.crawl(spname, **opts.spargs)
    print(&quot;此时启动的爬虫为：&quot; + spname)
self.crawler_process.start()
</code></pre>
<p>在此文件同级目录下创建初始化文件，文件名为：init.py<br>
最后我们需要添加自定义命令。在settings.py文件中，添加<br>
<code>COMMANDS_MODULE='项目核心目录.自定义命令源码目录'</code><br>
其中项目核心目录名即为项目命，源码目录名即为step2中所创建文件夹名。<br>
做完上述步骤后，在命令行中输入<code>scrapy -h</code>并执行，应当可以看到我们自定义的命令名。<br>
创建几个爬虫然后测试运行即可看到效果。</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>今天尝试改进之前的爬虫，利用多线程与队列提高爬取效率。<br>
想法是分为三个线程：</p>
<p>线程1负责逐页爬取帖子的url并将其置入队列中。<br>
线程2负责逐个获取帖子的标题、图片，并根据标题命名保存。<br>
线程3为控制线程，每60秒检测一次队列，在队列为空时终止程序。<br>
测试过程中依然存在一些问题：</p>
<p>虽然使用了多线程，但线程1与2间运行速度相差过大，运行依然低效，整个爬取过程耗时2500s。<br>
若使用<code>exit（）</code>结束程序，在VSCode内运行时会报错，但实际上并不是错误。<br>
最后，我本意是用搜狗微信来爬取公众号文章，但搜狗存在反扒机制，现阶段我还不会解决，以后再说。<br>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>今天第一次实战python网页爬虫，尝试爬取一个游戏网站上全部的游戏封面图片。<br>
（这些图片使用外站图床）<br>
测试中，成功获取到了所有图片的url，但是访问图片url时一直报错“403 Forbidden”。<br>
（opener添加了headers）<br>
搜索后我尝试了几个可能的解决方法：</p>
<ul>
<li>多写几个headers，每次随机抽取使用</li>
<li>设置若干代理服务器</li>
<li>设置<code>time.sleep()</code>以降低访问频率</li>
</ul>
<p>但都解决不了问题。<br>
在翻看其他人写的爬虫时，我注意到有些爬虫的headers中除了User-Agent还有一项Referer。<br>
于是我仔细地看了遍页面的Request Headers，发现有一项“referer”的值正是该游戏网站的url。<br>
我猜测，要在headers中添加referer信息“告知”网站这是真实用户的访问请求，爬虫才能正常访问。<br>
给headers添加<code>(&quot;Referer&quot;, &quot;https://****.fun&quot;)</code>后，爬虫果然可以进行正常爬取。</p>
<p>PS.<br>
初次编写爬虫，虽然可以正常运行并爬取了3000多张图片，但是爬取速度并不理想。<br>
下一步学习编写多线程爬虫来提高运行效率。</p>
